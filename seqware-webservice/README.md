# [Niassa](..) Web Service

The Niassa
[Web service](https://oicr-gsi.github.io/niassa-docs/current/web-service) 
is a RESTful API to facilitate access to the 
[MetaDB](https://oicr-gsi.github.io/niassa-docs/current/metadb) 
with user-specific permissions. It is also used extensively by 
[Pipeline](https://oicr-gsi.github.io/niassa-docs/current/pipeline) 
and the MetaDB to update and maintain analysis status and records. For full 
details, see our
[project homepage](https://oicr-gsi.github.io/niassa-docs/).
