     * Process the request and modify the response entity with cached data.
     * 
     * The manual update implementation of CachedDocument does the following:
     * 
     * GET operation:
     * - if cached document has not be produced or the cache has been invalidated - update document (blocking operation) and return document
     * - if the cached document is valid, - return the cached document
     * 
     * REFRESH operation:
     * - update the cached document (blocking operation if only refresh operation, non-blocking for subsequent refresh operations)
     * 
     * INVALIDATE operation:
     * - immediately invalidate the cached document (non-blocking operation)
     * 
     * 
     * The response provided as an argument is modified as follows:
     * GET operation:
     * - the response representation entity is set to the cached document
     * - the response representation modification date is set to the time that the document was produced
     * 
     * REFRESH operation:
     * - FIRST refresh request: the response status is set to SUCCESS(200)
     * - if other refresh request is processing (subsequent refresh requests): the response status is set to ACCEPTED(202)
     * 
     * INVALIDATE operation:
     * - the response status is set to SUCCESS(200)
     *
     * @param response the response that is to be modified
     * @param op       the cache operation that is to be performed
