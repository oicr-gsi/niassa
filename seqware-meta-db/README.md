# [Niassa](..) MetaDB

The Niassa [MetaDB](https://oicr-gsi.github.io/niassa-docs/current/metadb) is a
database for tracking metadata (data that describes other data) used by the
other Niassa components. It serves two primary functions: the 'top half' stores
information to model the run of sequencing instruments and LIMS information,
including studies, experiments, samples, lanes and instrument runs; and the
'bottom half', which stores analysis information like workflows, parameters, and
result files.

For full details, see our
[project homepage](https://oicr-gsi.github.io/niassa-docs/).
