# [Niassa](..) Pipeline

The Niassa [Pipeline](https://oicr-gsi.github.io/niassa-docs/current/pipeline)
is a set of workflow engines, a Java workflow API, and a series
of tools for installing, running, and monitoring workflows. It relies on the
[Web service](https://oicr-gsi.github.io/niassa-docs/current/web-service) and
[MetaDB](https://oicr-gsi.github.io/niassa-docs/current/metadb)
